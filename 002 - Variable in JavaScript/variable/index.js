    Before we start the lecture let's get familiar with the naming convention of javascript files.
    1] all letter should be lower-case.
    2] may include underscore(_) or dashes(-) no other punctuation.

    // rules for naming the variable (look in to the notes)

 */

// begin with letter
let a = 45
// begin with underscore
let _num = 45
// begin with Dollar ($)
let $num2 = 26
// Start with capital letter
let Num = 96
let num = 45

// num and Num both are different variable  as javascript is case sensitive.
console.log("Num "+ Num)
console.log("num "+ num)

console.log(a,_num,$num2,Num)

// let 5first_name = "noble"  // throw error because variable name starting with number is not allowed.


// In the next lecture we will look into different ways to declare variable using
//  let || var
// We will also learn about the use of the
//  const
// for declaring the constants
